Hybrid cloud environments offer the best of cloud and on-premises worlds, but also offer new challenges in managing them. In this session, you can learn how the largest companies in the world are maintaining the highest levels of service in these environments \u2013 by evolving from old school monitoring to IT service assurance. This session covers: The anatomy of IT services\u2013in the cloud and on-premises; the difference between monitoring and IT service assurance; the best way to ensure service delivery in a hybrid IT environment; and a customer case study where 97% of infrastructure was transitioned to the cloud. A service-centric approach not only ensures the end-to-end health of IT services and applications, but also enables uninterrupted operations before, during, and after migrations to the cloud. IT service assurance is the modern approach for enabling enterprise IT organizations to quickly and effectively onboard cloud resources and ensure consistent service delivery across cloud and on-premises systems. This session breaks down a real-world case study demonstrating how one customer seamlessly migrated 97 percent of its physical infrastructure to the cloud without disruptions, while also identifying system interdependencies and redundant equipment to avoid the costs of transitioning unnecessary systems.
