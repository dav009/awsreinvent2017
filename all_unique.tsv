MSC302 -	As customers put more workloads into AWS, the number of VPCs a customer needs to manage also grows. VPCs can exist across geographically disparate AWS Regions, or run in separate AWS accounts connecting to a common VPC that serves as a global network transit center. This session shows you how to implement a networking construct that AWS calls a transit VPC using the Cisco Cloud Services Router. This network topology simplifies network management and minimizes the number of connections that you need to set up and manage. Even better, it is implemented virtually and doesn't require physical network gear or a physical presence in a colocation transit hub. Come hear why customers are procuring this service through AWS Marketplace and how customers are using the transit VPC for private networking, shared connectivity, and cross-account AWS usage.	14523

Classic approaches just don’t make sense, because tools and process can only take you so far. You need a fresh look at what security means in these environments. Serverless applications let you focus on solving the problem at hand. Gone are most of the worries of traditional solutions. No more support code. No more building out infrastructure to deliver your application. This means you have to do less and get more in return. Classic operations fall by the wayside and you can scale your team in unprecedented ways. But what does this mean for security? No matter the design pattern, you’re always responsible for your data, even if you’re not running the underlying infrastructure. How do you make sure your data is safe and secure if you can’t apply the usual set of security controls? In this session, we explore how serverless designs impact security.

Frequently, disparate systems and organizational silos duplicate alerts and monitoring metrics with confusing communications. The result? An on-call responder faces a pile of unfamiliar alerts, describing unknown conditions, in systems they've never heard of. This problem can be exacerbated by the development velocity enabled by adoption of AWS tooling.  What if you could receive alerts with context, clarifying those muddy waters? What if you could adopt a systemic approach to helping responders identify issues? In this session, we explore the VictorOps and CloudWatch integration, with a focus on the VictorOps Incident Automation Engine. This integration enables CloudWatch alerts to include links to relevant runbooks, graphs, and other contextual breadcrumbs to help your teams more quickly identify and resolve alerts. Attendees should have some basic familiarity with CloudWatch, and on-call responsibilities.

A policy-driven management and governance strategy is critical to successfully operate in cloud and hybrid environments. As infrastructure grows, you might leverage knowledge that extends beyond the organization. An open-source “cloud policy framework” enables users to leverage a community that can help define and tune best practice policies, and help SaaS vendors and ISVs capture the best way to manage an application and share it with customers. A well-defined management and governance strategy enables you to put automation in place that keeps your cloud running securely and efficiently without having to take it on as a full-time job. This session discusses the development of a “cloud policy framework” that enables users to leverage open source rule definition organizations can use to govern their cloud. Learn best practice policies for managing all aspects of services, applications, and infrastructure across cost, availability, performance, security and usage.
